# GH-Actions-Dashboard
![](imgs/screencapture-localhost-3000-2022-09-05-22_41_18.png)

Since GitHub does not offer a way to display all running workflows in an organization I hacked together this quick little page.

It uses the GitHub Webhooks for notifications and distributes them to all connected frontends.

What I want to extends this with:
- simple flat-file sqlite Database, for storing information about jobs so there is inital data. 
- add normal workflows and not only jobs
- calculate some fun statistics about jobs for BI
- *Maybe* user-authentication some time
- Integrate GitHub Webhook Authentication with tokens
- Build docker-images and docker-compose file for easy peasy deployments
